	<h2>Last November, I had the remarkable opportunity to serve as a legislative page. Here you'll read all about my experience
	at the Legislative Assembly of Ontario.</h2>

	<h3>
		What is a legislative page and what do they do?
	</h3>
	
	<p class = "pagedescription">
		Pages work in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario for two to four weeks, with a granted leave of absence for school.
		They wear a traditional uniform and act as messengers in the Legislative Chamber, whether it is bringing water to the MPPs
		or delivering notes in and out of Queenâ€™s Park. They meet with politicians and officials, learn how laws are made, and learn
		how the Province of Ontario is governed. On Fridays, they go on a field trip or participate in an educational activity.

	<h3>Preparing to Be a Page</h3>
	<!--list-->
	<ul>
		<li>Lots of memorization!
			<ul>
				<li>Memorize names of 124 MPPs (Member of Provincial Parliament)</li>

				<li>Memorize their party (e.g. PC (Progressive Conservatives), Liberal, etc.)</li>
				<li>Memorize their seat in the Chamber</li>
				<li>Memorize their title (e.g. Minister of Education, Premier, Minister of Foreign Affairs, etc.)</li>
			</ul></li>
		<li>My notes looked something like this:</li>

	<!--concluding text-->
	<p class = "concluding-text">
		This experience taught me so much about what goes on behind the scenes in the planning of our province. I could see the
		true passion in every MPP (member of provincial parliament) fighting for which rules they believe should be enforced in the
		province. I also met so many incredible people and role models in Ontario. This experience was once again a dream come true and
		taught me numerous amounts. <br>
