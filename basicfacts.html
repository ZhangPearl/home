		My brother is eighteen&ndash;years&ndash;old and in his first year studying at Ryerson University. He studies photography
		and always helps me retake my clumsily taken photos on my phone. Below some of his works. <br> <br>

		My family has had pretty much every pet you could think of from dogs to hamsters, to birds, and bunnies.
		My first cat, Maya, is a black and white cat who is five&ndash;years&ndash;old. She is a bit of a scaredy&ndash;cat and always
		has to follow me around wherever I go in the house. She is slim and elegant, unlike my other cat, Poppy. He is three&ndash;years&ndash;old
		and loves to play, eat, and sleep. Below are some photos of them.<br> <br>

	<p class = "hobbies-text">
		Hobbies: dancing, playing piano, reading <br> <br>
		My favourite task to do in my free time is to dance. You can read all about my experiences <a href = "dance.html">here.</a> <br> <br>
		
		I have been playing piano since the age of six. Over the past year, I have finished my level 10 practical exam and my level 10
		Harmony and Counterpoint theory exam. For now, I am going to take a pause with lessons and only play in my spare time. <br> <br>
		<!--inserting photos-->
		<img src = "images/pearlpiano.jpg" alt = "Pearl playing piano"> <br> <br>
		During my free time, I also enjoy reading. Over quarantine, I finally decided to read the Harry Potter series to see
		what all the fuss was about. After finishing all seven books and movies, I officially understand why it is such a popular book
		series and fell in love with it myself. I am mainly an audio learner, so I found that listening to an audiobook helps me get through
		books much more quickly. <br> <br>
